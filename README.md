# QuBlitz Virtual Qubit Simulator
## High Level Summary 
### Overview 
Qublitz is a simulation tool aimed to lower the barrier to entry for students in high school and college trying to learn about Quantum Engineering. All simulations on Qublitz demonstrate the behavior of a single, two level qubit that occupies states between 1 and 0. Qublitz contains several simulation environments: Free Play, Gates Challenge, Step Pulse Challenge, Custom Qubit Query and Neutral Atoms. The engine behind every mode in Qublits is 'quantum_simulator.py' which takes in given parameters to simulate the behavior of a single, two level qubit. 
### Free Play Mode
Free play mode is a sandbox grants users access to most parameters necessary to simulate any qubit behavior they want to. There are two simulation modes in Free Play, the time domain and frequency domain. 
In the time domain, the user can determine both the qubit's properties and send a micorwave square pulse to see how it reacts in the Bloch sphere and graphs of the expected probability of the bit being in the 1 state. 
In the frequency domain, the user can observe the responsiveness of a qubit to a range of different driving frequencies (frequency of the pulses we influence the qubit with) 

### Gates Challenge [UNITARY HACK ISSUE]
The Gates Challange is, unlike free play mode, a directed game that follows a story structure with a tutorial and challenges for the user that get progressively more difficult. The challenges are focused on helping the user practice navigating along the bloch sphere using X and Y gates. The simulation of X and Y Gates rely on
